Revision history for Data-Printer

0.15    30/05/2011
    OTHERS:
        - updating filters docs
        - adding default color for DateTime filter

0.14    30/05/2011
    NEW FEATURES:
        - allowing 'colored' display customization to control colored
          output. Default is 'auto', showing colors only when
          output is not being piped. You may also set this to 0 to
          disable colors completely, or 1 to enable output coloring
          all the time (even when piped).
        - new 'caller_info' display customization.
        - default 'class_method' is now set to '_data_printer', so your
          modules and apps can be aware of Data::Printer automatically.

    BUG FIXES:
        - Skipping calls to fcntl() in systems that don't support it.

0.13    24/05/2011
    CHANGES THAT ***BREAK*** BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:
        - 'external' is now called '-external' to avoid name clash
          with a potential "external.pm" class;
        - filters for the same type/class are now stacked and called
          in order. The first one that returns a defined value (string)
          is used, otherwise it will forward the call to the next filter.
          In earlier versions, the last declared filter would be the one
          used. Note that this feature is only available for stand-alone
          filters, since inline filters are actually a hash.

    NEW FEATURES:
        - use a specific dump method via the 'class_method' display
          customization (default undef)
        - display tie information via the 'show_tied' display
          customization (default true)
        - display extra information (mode, flags, layers) on I/O handles
        - new '-class' type (note the dash) called when we find a
          non-native type (i.e. an object). If you return anything at
          all - even an empty string - the filter will succeed. Otherwise
          it will forward the call to the next '-class' filter, in order.
        - new DDP package alias


    OTHERS:

        - improved documentation

0.11    03/05/2011
    NEW FEATURES:
        - allowing 'sort_keys' display customization (default true)
        - allowing 'sort_methods' class display customization (default true)
        - now you can add options to Data::Printer as a plain hash, not
          just as a hash ref (feature request by edenc)

    NEW ***EXPERIMENTAL*** FEATURES:
        - Data::Printer::Filter, enabling separate filter classes
        - filter for modules handling date and time (DateTime & friends)
        - filter for database modules (DBI only for now)

    OTHERS:
        - more tests

          to 1 (expand only the object itself)

    OTHERS:
        - removed ending comma from arrays and hashes
        - showing parents/ISA information only when it's there
        - default separator for key/values reduced to 3 spaces for
          improved readability.
        - improved test suite

0.07    02/04/2011
    BUG FIXES:
        - Making sure File::HomeDir is 0.91 or higher
        - Making tests stricter, since they were failing on Win32

0.06    31/03/2011
    BUG FIXES:
        - if you want to call p() from within a filter, the
          argument to p() must be passed as a *reference*. This
          is now enforced to avoid users shooting themselves in the foot.
        - more tests added

0.05    23/03/2011
    NEW FEATURES:
        - local configuration file support ($HOME/.dataprinter)

        - reseting colors before starting

0.02    13/02/2011

    CHANGES THAT BREAK BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:
        - d() function removed. You can now call p($var) in void context to print,
          or as "my $output = p($var)" to retrieve results without printing.

    NEW FEATURES:
        - new import syntax, use Data::Printer { option => value }
        - new "filters" property available to filter certain types.
        - updated documentation.

    NEW ***EXPERIMENTAL*** FEATURES
        - local properties setting, p($var, key => value).

    BUG FIXES:
        - properly handles GLOB references
        - colors now work on Win32 as well.
        - uncolors piped output, for "less" & friends (thanks Getty for reporting).
        - added all possible regex modifiers to the regex output.
        - more tests added.
