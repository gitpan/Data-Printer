Revision history for Data-Printer

0.02    13/02/2011

    CHANGES THAT BREAK BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:
        - d() function removed. You can now call p($var) in void context to print,
          or as "my $output = p($var)" to retrieve results without printing.

    NEW FEATURES:
        - new import syntax, use Data::Printer { option => value }
        - new "filters" property available to filter certain types.
        - updated documentation.

    NEW ***EXPERIMENTAL*** FEATURES
        - local properties setting, p($var, key => value).

    BUG FIXES:
        - properly handles GLOB references
        - colors now work on Win32 as well.
        - uncolors piped output, for "less" & friends (thanks Getty for reporting).
        - added all possible regex modifiers to the regex output.
        - more tests added.
